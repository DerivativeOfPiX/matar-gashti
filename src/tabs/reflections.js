                <div className="text-white py-2 px-5"><p><i>‘Karachi - I love saying that name, it sounds like a Neapolitan curse, don’t you think, Father?’ (The Collector of the World by Iliya Troyanov).</i></p>
                    <p>Flamboyant and pompous as it is, Karachi has been a dervish-like sailor at the edges of the same sea it has married itself to. The tales have recorded, as if to anchor Karachi’s boat, all nebulous secrets. The nocturnal, expansive, and universe-like city is hardly missed out by any writer. Karachi even in its blandest of existence is an ever-growing land of fortunes (and misfortunes).</p>
                    <p>‘City’, the definitive trait of Karachi is saliently questioning; what makes a city?  Before even reading Karachi like the book it prevails to be, the city that guards Karachi is a question of heightened significance. What makes this city so pertinent is the key to the doors of its wandering. From Deyan Sudjic’s book ‘The language of cities’, the city ‘offers citizens the freedom to be what they want to be’. However, it is imperative to highlight the freedom even in its most banal concept to have a growth attached to it. No City has ever sprung into existence handed with freedom like a gift bag. The freedom that a city gains is fought against the fear restricting it. There is no place safe from evil. The existence of being free imposes that there is something to be freed from.</p>
                    <p>Mexico city, an apt parallel to Karachi, is a city known to make a universe of its own with a personality that was once considered a doomed settlement, it offered home to ‘some 2 million people’ in the 1940s. Which was an invitation for violence and crime to become a constant regime. ‘But Mexico City never became the horror story that is sometimes threatened. It has growth that tapers off, almost to the point where one could begin to consider the idea that growth might be self-limiting’. Juxtaposing Mexico City with Karachi, it is ‘one of the fastest growing cities in Asia…. With a population estimated at 9.5 million in 1995 (which is an underestimate)’. It has created a language of presence from its creation. Like Mexico, Karachi is a demographic city constantly seeking itself out of horror stories.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the quest of understanding the rhythms of a city, and what makes it a city resides in the fictitious book, ‘The Invisible City’ by Italo Calvino. That of which is considered globally the holy scripture of imagining a city. Calvino profusely uses imagination as the center in this book. With a tour-like style, the narrator-Marco, narrates cities to Kublai Khan- the emperor. Each chapter is divided into memory, desire, signs, and other symbolism. Eventually, the story comes to a point of salvation for the reader when the different cities narrated turn out to have been one big city all long. All the narrations were a compartmentalised lens.</p>
                    <p>From the City of Isidure to Zobeide, the essence of each place is like a town. The exquisite mind of Calvino entertains the very core concept of exploration. The same exquisite energy that compels an inquisitive eye to originate under the topic of Karachi is the premise of this thesis. To approach Karachi with an innocent curiosity that converts the city into a kingdom of exploration. One primal mention by Calvino was of the city of Zirma. There was particular line that ignited the joy of living in Karachi. ‘a bind black man shouting in the crowd, a lunatic teetering on a skyscraper’s cornice, a girl walking with a puma on a leash’. Karachi, similar to Zirma, is a city of happening. It is spontaneous, riveting, and like the sea, it’s waves come and go doing as it pleases.</p>
                    <p>Besides the fictitious mentions, it is worth noting and diving into the intensive qualitative research done previously in Karachi. A city without its crowd is better called the city of dead. Therefore, old interviews of Karachittes dig up insightful interactions. The way they behave corresponds to how Karachi is liveable. Since a large population resides in Karachi and is scattered all over, it is suffice to make a comparison with Calvino’s Invisible Cities. That is to say, each crowd of Karachi has a different caliber, a different method of viewing the street, and a different approach to the streets.</p>

                <h1 className="text-center text-white my-5">"What's it like, living in Karachi ?"</h1>
                <div className="text-white py-2 px-5">
                    <p>The next time someone asks what is it like living in Karachi; I will list down tales from the parks. Let me address the elephant in the cage, the one that banged its head against the bars. It lives in the far edge of safari park. Let me tell you about the time a ranger yelled at me for climbing a tree. He told me, while standing in the middle of a forest; he would shoot me if I did not listen. Or the time I caught a guard playing with his gun; his eyes inches away from the muzzle.</p>
                    <p>There is a park across the church, next to a mosque, facing a brothel. There is a man. I want you to picture him in neon pink pants with golden wings glued on each of his back pockets. He watched over my bosom, the way people watched his bottom.</p>
                    <p>Let me tell you about that one playground with a broken tunnel. It looked like an empty vessel but when I peeked inside, there was a blanket planked against the holes. It wrapped two shirtless boys like a burrito. They slept to the white noise of traffic. And let me also mention the green land that got wedded to signboards.</p>
                    <p>Once the list completes, I will sing tales of the lovers spot. I want to map down all the handholding points. The hide and seek of the couples, ones that kiss inside hollow shrubs, and ones that shelter under the darkness of a broken lamp.</p>
                    <p>At approximately one 630 a.m. I stood at the gates of a park and witnessed a group of Khawaja Siras rule the streets, coloring my bars for split seconds, their voices echoing against their engines. Some were travelling on motorbikes, some hanging from the backseat of a rickshaw.</p>
                    <p>And when all is done, I will tell you about a hill. Ten years ago, on September 9, Irfan carved a confession on the walls of a muddy hut. To this day, it stands requited by Junaid. To this day, their names stand untouched, and overlooked. To this day, Irfan loves Junaid, and Junaid loves Irfan. At least, I hope.</p>
